# Optimization

This section provides a comprehensive description of the optimization framework employed by ctrl-freeq. The numerical optimal control problem is solved using a variety of gradient-based and derivative-free algorithms, which are documented in detail alongside the configuration parameters governing the pulse design, quantum system specification, and computational resource allocation. For users of the graphical interface, the parameters described herein correspond directly to the configurable fields exposed in the GUI.
